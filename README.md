## Description

For users with a Puppet Enterprise 2019 or open source Puppet 6 infrastructure
wanting to leverage secrets from an existing [Hashicorp
Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) server. Used with Puppet 6's Deferred type,
this allows agents to retrieve secrets from Vault when a catalog is applied. In
this way, the secret data is not embedded in the catalog and the master never
sees it. See [this blog
post](https://puppet.com/blog/secret-agents-man-secrets-store-integrations-puppet-6)
for more information and other secret store integrations.

Authentication with Vault is achieved via Puppet certificates. See the
Vault documentation for more information on setting up finer grained access
controls.

## Requirements

This is expected to be run using the `Deferred` type, which requires Puppet
6.0.0 or later, and of course [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to store the
data.

## Setup

The `vault_lookup` function uses the Puppet agent's certificates in order to
authenticate to the Vault server; this means that before any agents contact a
Vault server, you must configure the Vault server with the Puppet Server's CA
certificate, and Vault must be part of the same certificate infrastructure.

To set up Vault to use the Puppet Server CA cert:

1. Set up Vault using Puppet certs (if not already set up this way)
  If the Vault host has a Puppet agent on it then you can just use the existing
  certificates. Otherwise generate a new certificate with `puppetserver ca` and
  copy the files.

```
puppetserver ca generate --certname my-vault.my-domain.me
```

  In the Vault listener configuration, set `tls_client_ca_file` as the Puppet CA
  cert, `tls_cert_file` as the agent or generated certificate, and
  `tls_key_file` as the agent or generated private key.

2. Enable cert auth for Vault
  Hashicorpâ€™s Vault supports a variety of auth methods that are listed in their
  documentation; the auth method required for usage with the vault_lookup
  function is named cert, and can be turned on with the Vault CLI:

```
$ vault auth enable cert
```
3. Upload the Puppet Server CA certificate to Vault.
  After cert auth has been enabled for Vault, upload the CA certificate from
  your Puppet Server to Vault and add it as a trusted certificate.

```
$ vault write auth/cert/certs/puppetserver \
    display_name=puppet \
    policies=prod,test \
    certificate=@/path/to/puppetserver/ca.pem \
    ttl=3600
```

Once the certificate has been uploaded, any Puppet agent with a signed
certificate will be able to authenticate with Vault.

## Usage

Install this module as you would in any other; the necessary code will
be distributed to Puppet agents via pluginsync.

In your manifests, call the `vault_lookup::lookup` function using the Deferred
type. For example:

```puppet
$d = Deferred('vault_lookup::lookup', ["secret/test", 'https://vault.hostname:8200'])

node default {
  notify { example :
    message => $d
  }
}
```

The lookup function will be run on the agent and the value of `$d` will be
resolved when the catalog is applied. This will make a call to
`https://vault.hostname:8200/v1/secret/test` if the secret mount is KVv1 or `https://vault.hostname:8200/v1/secret/data/test` if the secrete mount is KVv2 and wrap the result in Puppet's
`Sensitive` type, which prevents the value from being logged.

You can also choose not to specify the Vault URL, and then Puppet will use the
`VAULT_ADDR` environment variable. This will be either set on the command line, or
set in the service config file for Puppet, on Debian `/etc/default/puppet`, on RedHat
`/etc/sysconfig/puppet`:

```
$d = Deferred('vault_lookup::lookup', ["secret/test"])

node default {
  notify { example :
    message => $d
  }
}
```
Above code pulls KV V1 secret stored in path secret 'secret/test' in root namespace mounted on default cert path 'cert'. these values can be customized using following Parameters :

|Parameter|Optional/Mandatory|Default Vaule|description         |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|**path**|Mandatory||path of secret to read.|
|**vault_url**|Optional|Nil|if not provided, i will look for VAULT_ADDR environment variable. if the environment variable is not set, it would fail.|
|**vault_namespace**|Optional|Nil|if not provided, it will look for VAULT_NAMESPACE environment variable. if the environment variable is not set, it would assume default as root namespace and try to connect to root namespace.|
|**vault_cert_path**|Optional|cert|Path where the cert auth method mounted. if not pvoided, assumes cert auth method is enabled on default path 'cert'.|
|**vault_cert_role**|Optional|puppetserver|Role anme for Puppet certificate role. if not provided, assumes role as 'puppetserver'.|
|**key_field**|Optional|Nil|specific key for which value to be retrieved. If not provided Hash of both key and value pairs stored in the secret path would return.|

Example 1: to read secrets stored in path 'vault-test/data/puppet-vault-test' under 'custom-vault' namespace with cert Auth mounted on path 'auth-vault-puppet-cert' and role name 'puppetserver'. this would return hash of all secrets stored under the path vault-test/data/puppet-vault-test.

```
  $vaulttest = Deferred('vault_lookup::lookup', ['vault-test/data/puppet-vault-test', 'https://vault.hostname:8200/', 'custom-vault','auth-vault-puppet-cert','puppetserver'])
  $vaulttestunwrapped = Deferred('unwrap',[$vaulttest])
  notify { 'unwrappedexample-PROD' :
    message => $vaulttestunwrapped
  }
```
* Example 2: to read secrets stored in path 'vault-test/data/gitlab-ci-vault-test' under 'custom-vault' namespace with cert Auth mounted on path 'auth-vault-puppet-cert' and role name 'secondpuppetserver' and read the vaule stored for the key 'dbpass'. this would return value store for 'dbpass' under the path vault-test/data/gitlab-ci-vault-test.

```
  $vaulttestsecond = Deferred('vault_lookup::lookup', ['vault-test/data/gitlab-ci-vault-test', 'https://vault.hostname:8200/', 'custom-vault','auth-vault-puppet-cert','secondpuppetserver','dbpass'])
  $vaulttestunwrappedsecond = Deferred('unwrap',[$vaulttestsecond])
  notify { 'unwrappedexample-PROD-second' :
    message => $vaulttestunwrappedsecond
  }

```
**Note: if you are using KVv1 path should look like _vault-test/gitlab-ci-vault-test_. If you are using KVv2, path should include data like _vault-test/data/gitlab-ci-vault-test_**
